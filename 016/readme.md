## Goal Statements

At the end of this experiment, we should be able to create a react ui-framework based from [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) that will be applicable with our design system and integrate react storybook for documentation and testing reusable components.

- Phase 1:
  - Explore the created [hov-ui-framework](https://github.com/HighOutputVentures/hov-ui-framework)
  - get the design system theme from the previous build
  - integrate it to our ui framework and export the needed components
  - publish it to npm
