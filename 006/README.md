## Goal Statements

The goal of this experiment is to establish a workflow in solving or building Data Science applications using ML tools.
This includes the following objectives:

1. To identify the requirements for the application or problem to be solved.
    - What type of problem is being solved?
    - What algorithm is more appropriate to use to solve the problem?
2. To methodologies in data preprocessing.
    - Acquiring/Gathering data.
    - Data manipulation or clean up.
    - Encoding data
    - Splitting of dataset (training and test datasets)
    - Feature scaling
3. To design and build models.
4. To be able to train and validate models.
