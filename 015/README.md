## Goal Statements

At the end of this experiment, we should be able to
- Phase 1:
  - Explore Tools within the Spline Editor
    - create a small library/collections of tutorials on how to use spline tool
  - To recreate the Hero section background with 3D model, in HOV context 
- Phase 2 (Optional)
  - Explore the option of manipulating the objects inside the model thru code (react-spline)
## Abstract
  `Spline` is an easy to use 2D/3D tool geared up for designers regardless of their 3D experience.
  We conducted this experiment to explore the spline tool and to create a library of video tutorials for 
  designers to make it as a guide for them if they want to try this tool and if they are new to this tool.
  
  We created video tutorials for the basics on how to do it from creating an object in the editor, creating an events and states
  for the objects animations, setting up camera and lighting, applying materials to the objects, importing and exporting.
  
  With spline tool designers are no longer limited to a static designs for websites or other things that needs designs, designers will now
  have the capabilities to create designs that are more interactive, beautiful and eye-catchy to the users.
