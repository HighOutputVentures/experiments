## Goal Statements

At the end of this experiment, we should be able to
- Phase 1:
  - Explore Tools within the Spline Editor
    - create a small library/collections of tutorials on how to use spline tool
  - To recreate the Hero section background with 3D model, in HOV context 
- Phase 2 (Optional)
  - Explore the option of manipulating the objects inside the model thru code (react-spline)
## Abstract
  `Spline` is an easy to use `2D/3D` tool geared up for `designers` regardless of their 3D experience.
  We conducted this experiment to explore the spline tool and to create a library of video tutorials for 
  designers to make it as a guide for them if they want to try this tool and if they are new to this tool.
  
  We created video tutorials for the basics on how to do it from creating an object in the editor, creating an events and states
  for the objects animations, setting up camera and lighting, applying materials to the objects, importing and exporting.
  
  We have also tried to clone this example https://twitter.com/i/status/1521215727319011328 and applied it on the hov-website, 
  but since we are not designers we have difficulties and come up with different design but the same functionalities as the example
  
  With spline tool designers are no longer limited to a static designs for websites or other things that needs designs, designers will now
  have the capabilities to create designs that are more interactive, beautiful and eye-catchy to the users.
## Conclusion
  `Spline design` is great and powerful tool in designing 3d and interactive web pages. Designers and frontend developers benifits to this tool that mostly
  `developer` and `designer's` objective is delivering a product that gives a better user experience and pleasant web design therefore spline tool is fit for this.
  
  `Spline design` tool is capable of creating an animated web design that adds mood to websites. This tool also can export design that is ready to ulilize
   or integrate in any website. The ease of use of this tool is one of the recommendable feature of this tool. 
  
   With sufficient `documentation` such as creating a `library` of how spline tool can be used together with attached relevant `information/references`. `Spline`      will be used in future project with ease and deliver good quality of product.

## Documentation
### React-Spline
 - The documentation on how to use `@splinetool/react-spline` is well documented here https://www.npmjs.com/package/@splinetool/react-spline
### Limitations
 - using this code we can only trigger animation events from the spline tool editor, move and rotate the objects and lastly change the visibility
 - we cannot create an animation event and states with the code
