## Goal Statements

At the end of this experiment, we should be able to;

- Create a very simple Remix App
- Explore how remix handles data
- Explore different rendering techniques (SSR and CSR)
- Compare it to NextJS

## Abstract

With Remix, I was able to create a simple app that displays the current HOV employees in two ways, one is Server side generated

and the other one is Client side generated, I wasnt able to implement the other new rendering techniques (ISR & SSG) as both are not

yet available in Remix.

## Conclusion

Remix is a pretty neat framework for react, I really like how it defaults to rendering the page on the server, uses hooks to fetch data from a server

and submit data, built on top of react and uses file system type routing. however, I'd say NextJS is still the king for now; It offers alot more than

current version of Remix.
