## Goal Statements

At the end of this experiment, we should be able to create story for documenting and giving test demo for reusable component of a react project.

- Phase 1:
  - Explore on how to write stories
    - create an react application then build reusable component within it
    - stories then can be run locally and test reusable component inside it
  - Explore on how to write docs
    - create a good documentation of reusable component within the storybook
